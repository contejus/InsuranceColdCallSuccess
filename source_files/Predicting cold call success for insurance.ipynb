    "## Purpose\n",
    "Cold calling has been a controversial business route for both companies and customers alike, and the growth of mobile phones across the globe means that reaching people over the phone has never been easier. [92% of all customer interactions happen over the phone](https://blog.thebrevetgroup.com/21-mind-blowing-sales-stats), meaning that cold calling is still very relevant today.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both companies and consumers dislike cold calling for two main reasons: cold calling takes a long amount of time and cold calling can have detrimental effects when done improperly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This article will detail one possible route to improving cold call efficiency by utilizing public callee data to pre-emptively predict if a call will be successful. "

    "This dataset requires a lot of modification in order to be able to accurately predict successes. This is because our prediction models use numerical data to train themselves. If these numbers are very different from one another, or they appear to be randomly occurring, the algorithms we train will have a tough time trying to gain any \"insight\" on how to predict.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that for people, predicting the next number after 2, 4, 8, 16 is simple *because we can understand the pattern*. We see that the subsequent number is double the previous, and we use that *rule* to predict the following number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the computer uses algorithms to help it find the same rules we use. This is where the learning occurs. The machine would go through the data points and find a function, in this case y = 2^x, that it will use to predict the following number. Of course, the actual math and theory behind this is infinitely more complicated, but for our use case, this simple understanding is enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the credit card model, there are a lot of null values for the 'Outcome' column, but not very many successes or failures. We will most likely have to restructure our dataset by dropping these null values to improve the accuracy of our models. This has the negative effect of also reducing the size of our dataset, but the accuracy of the model won't change too much compared to if we had left the null values alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "CallStart and CallEnd aren't very useful attributes on their own, but we can generate a new column, 'CallLength', to better reflect what we want. It seems really important to know the length of a sales call, especially the differences in length between a successful call and a failed one. This process is called feature engineering, which uses existing data to create new data that is more relevant to our use case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also have to numerically map a lot of the categorical data present in this file. Categorical data is anything that isn't a number. Since our machine learning models use numbers to find the prediction rules, we map the non-numerical data to numbers and use that to train the model. \n"

While there were many data points, the tiny amount of relevant information in the Outcome column meant that our model had very little actual data to train with. Even with this poor quality data, our model still achieved 77% accuacy with the XGBoost algorithm.  \n",

    "For real-world use cases, a company could save a large amount of money avoiding calls that have a low chance of success simply by inputting some public information about the callee into our model. The consumer, on the other hand, will also deal with fewer irrelavant calls and will receive calls more related to what they actually need. In both cases, using machine learning to predict cold call success leads to beneficial outcomes for everyone involved.  \n",
